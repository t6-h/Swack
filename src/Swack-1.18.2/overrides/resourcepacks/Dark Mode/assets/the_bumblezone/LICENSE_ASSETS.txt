All Bumblezone Assets are ARR (All Rights Reserved).

This is due to some of the assets are music that I bought or asked for permission to use.
The Honey Slime's texture is actually from another mod given to me with permission.
As for the textures that i created myself, they are cool and I'm not mega attached to them but for simplicity, they are ARR along with the above stuff.

Please ask me if you want to know the source of some of the assets in Bumblezone or would like to borrow my textures I made.
Thank you!
